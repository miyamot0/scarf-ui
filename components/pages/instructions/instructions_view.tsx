                The purpose of this tab is for researchers to identify the
                purpose of their review, and to establish criteria for their
                review that allows them to take their specific contexts into
                consideration. For example, a researcher assessing interventions
                for severe challenging behavior might find fewer data points per
                condition adequate, due to ethical or safety reasons, while a
                researcher assessing interventions fo academic skills might
                require at least five data points per condition.
