# SCARF-UI

SCARF-UI is a simple, web-based widget to support the critical appraisals of studies conducted using single-case experimental designs (SCEDs) and visual analysis. The design and functionality of the tool models that of the SCARF toolkit produced by Dr. Jennifer Ledford and colleages, which is available [here](https://ebip.vkcsites.org/scarfv2/).

## Access/Building

Users are free to clone this serverless web-app, or alternatively, use the version that is hosted freely on vercel. The tool is presently hosted for all at [https://scarf-ui.vercel.app/](https://scarf-ui.vercel.app/)

## Usage

The tool is essentially a shot-for-shot re-imagining of the original SCARF tool, originally designed as a spreadsheet template, in a web-based design that supports more robust interfaces and visuals. Information about how to access the tool is provided in the tool itself.

## Contributing

At present, users are free to submit issues and suggest changes. Pull requests will be occasionally reviewed, but are rarely to be considered unless they significantly extend the original base functionality.
